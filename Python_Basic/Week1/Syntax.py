# Basic String syntax
name = "Sakir Ahamed"
print(name)

# We can use single quote also
name1 = 'Bangladesh is my country'
print(name1)

# If we use single quote in a sentence then use '\'
single_quote = 'This is Anannyar\'s property'
print(single_quote)

# User input
user_input = input('Give your name:')
print('This is your name:', user_input)

# Output formatting
number = 6
number_2 = 2
print(f'This is another number {number}, here is one also {number_2}')

# Another way of formatting
print('This is another number {0}, here is one also {1}'.format(number, number_2))
